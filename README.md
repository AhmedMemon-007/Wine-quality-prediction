# Wine Quality Prediction

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a wine dataset containing various chemical properties to predict wine quality. The objective is to develop a classification model that accurately categorizes the quality of wine based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **fixed acidity**
- **volatile acidity**
- **citric acid**
- **residual sugar**
- **chlorides**
- **free sulfur dioxide**
- **total sulfur dioxide**
- **density**
- **pH**
- **sulphates**
- **alcohol**
- **quality**: Target variable indicating the quality of the wine

## Model
I applied a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict wine quality based on these chemical properties. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated to understand its accuracy in classifying wine quality.

## Results
The model was assessed based on its accuracy and ability to differentiate between various quality levels, providing insights into the relationship between chemical properties and wine quality.
